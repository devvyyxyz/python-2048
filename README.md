This code is for a simple implementation of the game "2048" using Python's tkinter library for the GUI. The game is played on a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles, and the goal is to combine tiles to reach the value of 2048.

The code creates a Board class which creates the game board, and a Game class which handles the logic of the game. The Board class initializes the GUI elements using tkinter, creates the game board, and sets up the color scheme for the tiles. The Game class starts the game, sets up the event listener for key presses, and handles the movement of the tiles.

The compressGrid() method removes all empty cells in each row of the grid and shifts the remaining cells to the left to fill the empty spaces. The mergeGrid() method merges any adjacent cells with the same value, doubling the value and clearing one of the cells. The random_cell() method generates a new tile with the value of 2 at a random empty cell on the grid. The can_merge() method checks if there are any adjacent cells that can be merged. The transpose() and reverse() methods are used for handling key presses and grid manipulation.

To run the code, create a new Python file and copy the code. Install the tkinter library if it is not already installed, and run the Python file.
